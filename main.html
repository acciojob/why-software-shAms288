	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>Software development is an exciting and challenging field and 
		I enjoy solving complex problems and want to be a part of the rapidly growing technology industry. 
		It offers high earning potential, flexibility to work remotely, 
		opportunities to learn and grow, and the ability to make a real impact on the world. 
		It also provides a sense of personal satisfaction and 
		fulfillment when you see your own creation and ideas come to life through code.</p>
